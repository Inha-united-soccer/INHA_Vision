Hi 👋 We are Inha-United !
Inha-United is a team competing in the RoboCup Soccer Humanoid League.

This repository provides a comprehensive set of algorithms and methodologies required for a robot to autonomously perform a soccer game.

Starting from the demo provided by Booster Robotics, we have modularized the system, extended its functionality, and continuously improved its performance through our own research and development efforts.
